GIT- Distributed Version Control System while others like SVN are Central VCS
Distributed VCS- Everybody has a local repository synced to the last check out time

Config commands-
git config --global user.name "Soumadiptya"
git config --global user.email "soumadiptya@gmail.com"
git config --list- Lists all user variables

Get Help
git help config
git config --help

Common use cases-
1) Track an existing project using git- This is not at all recommended due to how many fucking problems seem to arise on trying to push code to a remote repository. Just clone a repo and proceed instead.
Initialize a repository from existing code-
git init
Before first commit-
git status
Add a gitignore-
touch .gitignore

Files in GIT can be in following stages
1) In your working directory- Untracked and Modified files
2) In a Staging Area- Organize what we want to be commited. Done by using git add and git commit
3) Push to remote- git push
Remove files from staging area-
git reset [filename]- If you use reset without any names it removes all files from the staging area.
Get log of all commits-
git log

To do a Git push now a days requires a SSH key. Here are steps to use it:
1) Generate SSH key ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "your_email@example.com"
2) Add it to your GitHub profile from the Settings
3) Add key to your ssh-agent
eval `ssh-agent -s`
ssh-add ./filename_of_your_key_file
This needs to be done each session. Surely there is a better way?
